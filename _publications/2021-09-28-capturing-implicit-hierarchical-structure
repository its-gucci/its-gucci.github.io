excerpt: 'Creating manual annotations for segementation, especially for high-resolution 3D image data, is expensive and time-consuming. We exploit the natural hierarchical organization of 3D biological data by using it as self-supervision to learn hyperbolic representations via a hyperbolic VAE, and use the learned representations to perform unsupervised 3D segmentation.'

Abstract: We consider the task of representation learning for unsupervised segmentation of 3D voxel-grid biomedical images. We show that models that capture implicit hierarchical relationships between subvolumes are better suited for this task. To that end, we consider encoder-decoder architectures with a hyperbolic latent space, to explicitly capture hierarchical relationships present in subvolumes of the data. We propose utilizing a 3D hyperbolic variational autoencoder with a novel gyroplane convolutional layer to map from the embedding space back to 3D images. To capture these relationships, we introduce an essential self-supervised loss---in addition to the standard VAE loss---which infers approximate hierarchies and encourages implicitly related subvolumes to be mapped closer in the embedding space. We present experiments on synthetic datasets along with a dataset from the medical domain to validate our hypothesis.
