excerpt: 'Creating representations of shapes that are invari-ant to isometric or almost-isometric transforma-tions has long been an area of interest in shape anal-ysis, since enforcing invariance allows the learningof more effective and robust shape representations.Most existing invariant shape representations arehandcrafted, and previous work on learning shaperepresentations do not focus on producing invariantrepresentations. To solve the problem of learningunsupervised invariant shape representations, weuse contrastive learning, which produces discrimi-native representations through learning invarianceto user-specified data augmentations. To producerepresentations that are specifically isometry andalmost-isometry invariant, we propose new dataaugmentations that randomly sample these transfor-mations. We show experimentally that our methodoutperforms previous unsupervised learning ap-proaches in both effectiveness and robustness.'
