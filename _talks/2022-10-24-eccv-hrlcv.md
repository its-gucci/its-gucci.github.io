As part of our ECCV 2022 tutorial [Hyperbolic Representation Learning for Computer Vision](https://sites.google.com/view/hyperbolic-tutorial-eccv22/homepage?pli=1) with 
[Pascal Mettes](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/p.s.m.mettes/), [Mina Ghadimi Atigh](https://minaghadimi.github.io/), 
[Martin Keller-Ressel](https://tu-dresden.de/mn/math/stochastik/mkeller/die-professur/profil?set_language=en), and [Serena Yeung](https://ai.stanford.edu/~syyeung/), 
I gave the third talk on recent research in unsupervised hyperbolic representation learning methods in computer vision. Slides for the talks can be found 
[here](https://sites.google.com/view/hyperbolic-tutorial-eccv22/slides) and notebooks walking through the basics of hyperbolic representation learning and some recent
research can be found [here](https://hyperbolic-representation-learning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
