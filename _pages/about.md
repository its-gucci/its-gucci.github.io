I am a final year Ph.D student at [ICME](https://icme.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University where I am part of the [Medical AI and ComputeR Vision Lab (MARVL)](https://marvl.stanford.edu/index.html). I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Serena Yeung](https://ai.stanford.edu/~syyeung/). Previously, I received a BS in Mathematics from Caltech. I have a broad range of research interests, including 3D computer vision, implicit neural representations, multimodal large language models, geometric deep learning, and AI for science applications (such as structural biology/cryo-EM)! You can reach me at jeffgu[at]stanford.edu.

I am currently on job market! I am looking for both industry opportunities and postdocs. Feel free to reach out!
