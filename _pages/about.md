I am a Ph.D candidate in [ICME](https://icme.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University where I am part of the [Medical AI and ComputeR Vision Lab (MARVL)](https://marvl.stanford.edu/index.html), where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Serena Yeung](https://ai.stanford.edu/~syyeung/). Previously, I received a BS in Mathematics from Caltech. My current research interests include geometric deep learning, unsupervised learning, representation learning, and applications to biology and science. You can reach me at jeffgu[at]stanford.edu!
